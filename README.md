# Work-day-planner

This assignment requires me to build a work day planner displaying current date and time  and featuring a schedule that shows the times between 09.00 and 17.00 as one hour blocks. For the current time and future dairy entries can be saved to local storage.

This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I write. 

 It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 


## Instructions

* Display the current day at the top of the calendar when a user opens the planner.

* Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.

* Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.

* Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock.

* Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.

* Persist events between refreshes of a page
